# Matlab Modelling of a Chopper Preamplifier for Proton Sound Detectors

This repository presents a theoretical and simulation-based study on the design and performance of a **Chopper Preamplifier (CP)** for **Proton Sound Detectors (ProSDs)**, as part of a Bachelor's thesis in Physics at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

## Project Overview

Proton Sound Detectors are promising tools in **hadron therapy**, leveraging the ionoacoustic effect to localize the **Bragg Peak** with high precision. However, their effectiveness is limited by the inherently low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), especially due to dominant **1/f (flicker) noise** in the low-frequency range.

This work explores a **Chopper Technique (CT)**-based solution, theoretically modeled and implemented in MATLAB, to mitigate flicker noise and enhance overall detection accuracy.

## Key Concepts

- **Ionoacoustic Effect:** Acoustic waves generated by rapid energy deposition during proton irradiation.
- **Chopper Preamplifier:** An analog circuit that modulates the input signal to higher frequencies where flicker noise is less significant, then demodulates and filters it.
- **1/f Noise Reduction:** The CT shifts low-frequency noise away from the signal band, allowing it to be removed via low-pass filtering.

## Thesis Contributions

- Developed a **fully modular MATLAB model** simulating the CP signal chain.
- Simulated signal and noise behavior through:
  - Modulation and demodulation stages
  - Noise generation (thermal and flicker)
  - Filtering and RMS performance evaluation
- Demonstrated that CT reduces output-referred noise by over 4Ã— compared to traditional amplification.

## Results (Simulation-Based)

| Method           | Output-Referred Noise |
|------------------|------------------------|
| With CT          | 0.29 mVRMS             |
| Without CT       | 1.25 mVRMS             |

This corresponds to a theoretical dose reduction factor of ~16 in clinical terms, assuming averaging is replaced with chopper-based processing.
